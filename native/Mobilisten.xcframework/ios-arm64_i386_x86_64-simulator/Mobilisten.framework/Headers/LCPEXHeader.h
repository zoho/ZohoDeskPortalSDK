 * \section install_sec Installation
 *
 * 1) Download and extract WMSApi.zip
 
 2) After Extracting add the files present inside WMSApi/SupportingFiles/ to your project
 
 3) Add "libPEXLibrary.a" present inside WMSApi/lib folder to your project
 
 4) Extend LDChatHandler, CollaborationHandler, LDMessageHandler, LDServiceChatHandler, PresenceGroupHandler, LDCustomChatHandler, ContactsHandler depending upon your need
 
 5) Add the following frameworks to your project
 
 * i)CFNetwork.framework
 
 * ii)libicucore.dylib
 
 * iii)Foundation.framework
 
 * iv)CoreFoundation.framework
 
 6) In your code, enable the required wms configurations
 example:
 
 *    #import "LDWmsConfig.h"
 
      ….
 
      ….
 
      LDWmsConfig *config=[[LDWmsConfig alloc] init];
 
      [config enablePersonalPresence];
 
      [config enableOrgPresence];
 
      [config enableChatPresence];
 
 7) In case if you extend LDChatHandler and your derived interface name is TestClass then
 
      #import "PEXHeader.h"
 
      …
 
      ...
 
      TestClass *tc=[[TestClass alloc] init];
 
      [LDZohoMessenger setChatHandler:tc];
 
      // similarly for service related operations like Collaboration
 
      #import "LDZohoService.h"
 
      [LDZohoService setCollaborationHandler:<#(CollaborationHandler *)#>]
 
 8) Your interface must follow the protocol <LDConnectionHandler> (declared in LDPEXLibrary.h) and you must implement the methods declared in that protocol in your interface i.e., onConnect,onReconnect,onDisconnect and then register your interface to LDZohoMessenger with the following code
      [LDZohoMessenger setConnectionHandler:self];
 
 9) Each product has its unique Product code , which can be retrieved from LDWmsService.h
 
 10) In WMSProperties.plist , set your wms url for the key "wmsurl" default value is wss://mms.zoho.com
 
 11) Finally, start using LDZohoMessenger Api with the following code
 
 Create a LDPEXCredentials object based on your need.. There are two types of credentials with which you can connect - LDIAMAuthToken & LDIAMTicket. For LDIAMAuthToken, it is mandatory to set iscscope, else we'll throw PEXException if insufficient credentials are supplied.
 
      [LDZohoMessenger connect:credential :[LDWmsService CHAT] :[config getConfig]];
 
 The above method might throw PEXException if Improper credentials are supplied
 
 // variable config is mentioned in Step 6
 *
 12) To Create a LDPEXRequest,
 
 First import PEXHeader.h, LDWmsService.h
 
 We Recommend using a separate interface for a particular LDPEXRequest
 
 In that interface, in any of the methods, you can create a LDPEXRequest as follows
 
       LDPEXRequest *req=[[LDPEXRequest alloc] initRequestWithType:[LDWmsService product_name] andURL:theURL anddata:dict];
 
 Here "theURL" is a relative path from the product landing directory
 
 For example in order to call http://chat.zoho.com/mpchat.do , theURL will be just @"mpchat.do"
 
 "dict" refers to the dictionary of key-value pairs that you wish to send it to the wms server along with the PEX Request
 
       [req setMethod:@"POST"]; // The method can be set as @"GET", @"PUT", @"DELETE" etc signifying the HTTP counterpart.
 
       [req setHandler:self]; // Call this method so as to receive updates about the status of the LDPEXRequest. Your interface must obey LDPEXEventHandler protocol if you are calling this method
 
 
 Obey the protocol LDPEXEventHandler to get updates about the status of the pex request.
 
 then call
 
      @try {
 
      [LDPEXLibrary process:req];
 
      }
 
      @catch (PEXException *exception) {
 
 
 
      }
 
      @finally {}
 
 
 13) Similarly for calling API methods (for chat, collaboration, service chat, presence group, custom chat), invocation must be done as follows. API methods can be invoked by getting the respective instance of these interfaces from LDZohoMessenger, LDZohoService . Initializing the API's by yourself will return nil.
 
        @try {
 
        ChatInfoMessage *cim=[ChatInfoMessage TYPING];
        
        [[LDZohoMessenger CHAT] sendInfoMessage:chid andMsg:@"hello" andChatInfoMessage:cim andHandler:nil];
 
        }
 
        @catch (PEXException *exception) {
 
        }
        
        @finally {
        
        }
